Main functions:
1. Dynamically displays a list of all tasks.  
Each task has a checkbox on the left of its name, representing its completation status. Checked means it is completed.
2. Add a new task by inputting the task name on app header.  
After pressing [‚èé] on keyboard, system will check the validity of user input to avoid empty input. A alert is triggered to warn it.  
Also, restore the input textbox after adding a new task for better user experience so that users do not need to clear the previous input themselves.
